# Demon Eye (Hell)
## Many Demon eyes are watching you

This is the hell that I created, there are three types of tile
which are: The jail, Volcano, and the monster mouth.
Every click, there will be a Demon eye show up, so what I trying
to do is making the Demon eye in to different place.



Artist statement: The effect that I trying to do is making a nice Hell, but
somehow I think I kind of making a 'dump' work. The color of the tiles are 
not really 'Connected', but somehow it seem okay to lock the Demon eye in the hell
and in the monster mouth.
